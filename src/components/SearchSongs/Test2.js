// Test 2 - indie hip hop
/* 
Match: 6/18 (33%) - This would've worked if over half the playlist wasn't the same song.
1. Faded Curtains by Cap Kendricks - this sounded like an actual song lol, instrumental
2. MICHUUL. by Duckwrth - not from 2020 but this matches enough
3. Hip Hop Hurray by Diego Hdez - less than 1 minute long and not even hip hop
4. Digan Hip digan Hop - not in English, but it is definitely hip hop
5. South African Hip Hop Industry - matches search query!
6. Eva by Kastor - matches somewhat (instrumental)
7. Eva by Kastor (again?)
8. Eva by Kastor (again??)
9. Eva by Kastor (again??? unsure if mistake)
10. Eva by Kastor - yeah this is definitely repeating over and over again, not good prospects
11. Eva by Kastor - ...
