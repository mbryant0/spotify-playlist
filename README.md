# Agenda

1. Add functionality to form - create handlers to update form state to send to
   Spotify API

2. Refactor application so that user only has to press one button to submit form

3. Debug the part of application that sends user to different page to
   authenticate - automatically reroute back to localhost:3000

4. Add alerts to let user know their playlist has successfully been created
   (with hyperlinked URL that they can click on to see it in Spotify), or when
   there are errors with their input / the server

5. Add comments to code to improve readability

6. Refactor code to use either Redux or Context API to improve efficiency

7. Refactor the Genre selection to map over an array of genres imported from a
   separate file

8. Add the green color to list of Bootstrap theme colors for reusability

9. Add information about the purpose of the application and instructions for use
   on the page and in the README. And for other developers/employers, add
   information on how to host the application locally (npm install, npm start,
   etc)

10. Remove miscellaneous files, console.logs, and boilerplate...

11. Deploy application on Heroku so that everyone can use it!
